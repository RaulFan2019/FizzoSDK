		 *
		 * Currently the following version numbers are supported:
		 *
		 *   - 0.1 (0x01-00) - The service is connected to the device in application mode, not to the DFU Bootloader. The application supports Long Term Key (LTK)
		 *                     sharing and buttonless update. Enable notifications on the DFU Control Point characteristic and write 0x01-04 into it to jump to the Bootloader.
		 *                     Check the Bootloader version again for more info about the Bootloader version.
		 *
		 *   - 0.5 (0x05-00) - The device is in the OTA-DFU Bootloader mode. The Bootloader supports LTK sharing and requires the Extended Init Packet. It supports
		 *                     a SoftDevice, Bootloader or an Application update. SoftDevice and a Bootloader may be sent together.
		 *
		 *   - 0.6 (0x06-00) - The device is in the OTA-DFU Bootloader mode. The DFU Bootloader is from SDK 8.0 and has the same features as version 0.5. It also
		 *                     supports also sending Service Changed notification in application mode after successful or aborted upload so no refreshing services is required.

		 *  * no DFU Version characteristic - we may be either in the bootloader mode or in the app mode. The DFU Bootloader from SDK 6.1 did not have this characteristic,
		 *                                    but it also supported the buttonless update. Usually, the application must have had some additional services (like Heart Rate, etc)
		 *                                    so if the number of services greater is than 3 (Generic Access, Generic Attribute, DFU Service) we can also assume we are in
		 *                                    the application mode and jump is required.
		 *
		 *  * version = 1 (major = 0, minor = 1) - Application with DFU buttonless update supported. A jump to DFU mode is required.
		 *
		 *  * version = 5 (major = 0, minor = 5) - Since version 5 the Extended Init Packet is required. Keep in mind that if we are in the app mode the DFU Version characteristic
		 *  								  still returns version = 1, as it is independent from the DFU Bootloader. The version = 5 is reported only after successful jump to
		 *  								  the DFU mode. In version = 5 the bond information is always lost. Released in SDK 7.0.0.
		 *
		 *  * version = 6 (major = 0, minor = 6) - The DFU Bootloader may be configured to keep the bond information after application update. Please, see the {@link #EXTRA_KEEP_BOND}
		 *  								  documentation for more information about how to enable the feature (disabled by default). A change in the DFU bootloader source and
		 *  								  setting the {@link DfuServiceInitiator#setKeepBond} to true is required. Released in SDK 8.0.0.
		 *
		 *  * version = 7 (major = 0, minor = 7) - The SHA-256 firmware hash is used in the Extended Init Packet instead of CRC-16. This feature is transparent for the DFU Service.
		 *
		 *  * version = 8 (major = 0, minor = 8) - The Extended Init Packet is signed using the private key. The bootloader, using the public key, is able to verify the content.
		 *  								  Released in SDK 9.0.0 as experimental feature.
		 *  								  Caution! The firmware type (Application, Bootloader, SoftDevice or SoftDevice+Bootloader) is not encrypted as it is not a part of the
		 *  								  Extended Init Packet. A change in the protocol will be required to fix this issue.

			 * If the DFU Version characteristic is present and the version returned from it is greater or equal to 0.5, the Extended Init Packet is required.
			 * For older versions, or if the DFU Version characteristic is not present (pre SDK 7.0.0), the Init Packet (which could have contained only the firmware CRC) was optional.
			 * Deprecated: To calculate the CRC (CRC-CCTII-16 0xFFFF) the following application may be used: http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/software/index.html -> CRC library.
			 * New: To calculate the CRC (CRC-CCTII-16 0xFFFF) the 'nrf utility' may be used (see below).
			 *
			 * The Init Packet is read from the *.dat file as a binary file. This service you allows to specify the init packet file in two ways.
			 * Since SDK 8.0 and the DFU Library v0.6 using the Distribution packet (ZIP) is recommended. The distribution packet can be created using the
			 * *nrf utility* tool, available together with Master Control Panel v 3.8.0+. See the DFU documentation at http://developer.nordicsemi.com for more details.
			 * An init file may be also provided as a separate file using the {@link #EXTRA_INIT_FILE_PATH} or {@link #EXTRA_INIT_FILE_URI} or in the ZIP file
			 * with the deprecated fixed naming convention:
			 *
			 *    a) If the ZIP file contain a softdevice.hex (or .bin) and/or bootloader.hex (or .bin) the 'system.dat' must also be included.
			 *       In case when both files are present the CRC should be calculated from the two BIN contents merged together.
			 *       This means: if there are softdevice.hex and bootloader.hex files in the ZIP file you have to convert them to BIN
			 *       (e.g. using: http://hex2bin.sourceforge.net/ application), copy them into a single file where the soft device is placed as the first one and calculate
			 *       the CRC for the whole file.
			 *
			 *    b) If the ZIP file contains a application.hex (or .bin) file the 'application.dat' file must be included and contain the Init packet for the application.
